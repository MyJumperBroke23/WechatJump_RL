# WechatJump_RL
This repository includes different RL algorithms which are applied to the WeChat Jump game (search for 跳一跳 (tiao yi tiao))

This currently only works with the Vivo Nex S phone, but should be pretty easy to convert to any other android phone if needed. 

The code for the distance algorithm was taken from [this repo](https://github.com/Prinsphield/Wechat_AutoJump)
